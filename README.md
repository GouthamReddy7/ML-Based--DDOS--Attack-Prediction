**Detecting DDoS Attacks Using Machine-Learning Algorithms**


With the rapid growth of technology and the increasing reliance on the internet for various tasks, network security has become a critical concern. Among the various network attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the availability and stability of online services. In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised systems, often distributed across the globe, are used to flood a target system or network with an overwhelming amount of traffic. This flood of traffic can consume all available resources, making the target system or network inaccessible to legitimate users. Traditional DDoS attacks typically involve flooding a target with high volumes of traffic, exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols or application layers. However, as technology advances, so do the techniques used in DDoS attacks. Attackers constantly evolve their tactics to bypass traditional defense mechanisms and maximize the impact of their attacks. Machine learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for DDoS detection, leveraging the ability to analyze large volumes of network data and identify patterns indicative of malicious activity.



The study aims to assess various machine learning algorithms' efficacy in detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, a prevalent and severe cybersecurity threat. By collecting and preprocessing network traffic data, models will be trained and evaluated based on accuracy metrics. Comparative analysis will identify the most effective algorithms, considering factors like computational efficiency and robustness. The findings will inform network security practices, aiding in the development of more resilient defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks. Further research directions may involve optimizing models and exploring emerging attack trends to enhance detection capabilities and adaptability to evolving cyber threats. 

The research also involved rigorous evaluation and comparison of these techniques to determine their effectiveness in identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks. This evaluation included assessing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance.
Moreover, the deployment of the developed model on AWS not only facilitated accessibility but also allowed for scalability and real-time monitoring, enabling timely responses to emerging threats. Additionally, the research may have explored strategies for continuous model improvement and adaptation to evolving attack patterns to ensure long-term effectiveness in combating DDoS attacks.
